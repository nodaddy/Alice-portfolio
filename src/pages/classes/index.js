                Yoga maintains that chakras are center points of energy, thoughts, feelings, and the physical body. According to yogic teachers, chakras determine how people experience reality through emotional reactions, desires or aversions, levels of confidence or fear, and even physical symptoms and effects.

In Spite of the tough Yoga postures that she makes us perform, her holistic and soothing techniques, soft mantras, and cooling down at the end of every session, leaves us really rejuvenated by the end of it all. 
            Always happy to begin the day with her Yoga sessions 🙏🏻😊
