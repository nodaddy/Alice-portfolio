                As a child I was fascinated by magic, mythical stories, fairies, astrology & the moon cycles.I have always had a very strong belief that there is so much more to life than what is right in front of our eyes<br/>
                <br/>
                The healing path has always been part of my journey. My first career was nursing. I spent 15 years as a nurse working in various hospitals in the south of England and London. I volunteered and travelled with my nursing. My last post was as a sister in St Georges Accident & Emergency Department.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Despite my respect & love for western medicine as life savings as it can be. I started to sense something was missing in the care we were offering patients. The influence of big pharmaceutical companies in health care simply no longer resonated with me. I had always been attracted to other modalities of healing and started to explore alternative and complimentary therapies initially within the nursing structure. I strongly believe that healing in the future will be a dual approach. Allopathic & alternative medicine working together.

                A back injury from nursing pushed me towards my first regular yoga practice around 2008. Yoga not only gave me a solution to my back pain, it gave me the first experience of being able to control my racing, monkey, burnt out mind. Like many people my initial classes were in a gym. I soon became hooked on yoga and gravitated towards a vinyasa flow practice. I Resonated with a local teacher & regular class near my flat in Streatham. The philosophy and the guidance for life that came through with the practice just drove me to what to & learn more & more. I did my first 200hr teacher training in Vinyasa Flow with Claire Missingham in 2012. This training was a pivotal point in my life. A whole new world literally cracked open for me.

                <span style={{fontFamily: 'Raleway', fontSize: '16px'}}>
                Early 2014 I travelled to India to do some nursing volunteer work & I was drawn to take a course at the Krishnamachcharya yoga mandarin. Krishnamacharya is widely considered as the father or architect of vinyasa, viniyoga. I was keen to learn as close to the source as possible.My experience of being taught in India at the KYM was so profound & life changing. I got the call to return to India to work and live. In October 2014 I returned to India to work at a hospital in Guwahati, Assam. I met my husband Raj 3 weeks into my stay in Assam. The mythical stories and culture in India felt very familiar and like home.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My practice continued to deepen & I got drawn to the mythical embodied teachings of Sianna Sherman. Sianna ignited my childhood interest in nature, magic & astrology. I then went onto take the urban priestess course, with her which is a sacred vessel to honour both nature cycles and the feminine power that is innate in nature and all around us.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I completed my 500hr Rasa teacher training with Sianna in Bali in 2019. Rasa yoga fuses the yogic teachings with the rich teachings of tantra. Tantric wisdom and the rise of the divine feminine was a new wake up call for me. The practices calling me to embrace and reclaim the whole of myself and work to explore my shadow side to transform. The tantric dharsana or view is that the physical body is the temple for the soul & therefore a sacred vessel that should be nourished & nurtured. Was a complete game changer for myself & my practice. Sadhana is now part of my everyday life. Mantra, mudra, Mediation, movement. I use my body and my life experiences as my teaching material.
